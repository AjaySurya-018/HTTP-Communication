# HTTP-Communication
## Implementing Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) in client-server communication. 

### The program consists of the following functions:

1. **GET**: The contents of the requested resource should be displayed in the client. If the requested
resource is not available with the server, the server should communicate an error message to
the client.

2. **POST**: The server should create a new resource corresponding to the data communicated by
the client.

3. **PUT**: Client communicates the name of the resource to be updated, along with the updated
content. The server updates the content of the said resource accordingly. If the said resource
is not available with the server, the server creates a new resource with the updated content.

4. **DELETE**: Client communicates the name of the resource to be deleted in the server. The server
performs the deletion accordingly. If the corresponding resource is not present in the server,
an error message should be communicated to the client.
